Paul and Joe really helped us out on our Hackleberry-Finn Project and I wish it was a little simpler in scope. Paul did excellent design work and Joe went in search of the elusive facebook api for login. Anyway, I worked on the first API with nutritionix and it was eventually scraped because we couldnâ€™t keep our url from showing all of our info. I created the bio page and researched ChartJS.org for our graphs. We were thrilled to win first place and we owe so much of the work to Paul. It was a great learning experience and I've made great cohort friends with Paul and Joe.
